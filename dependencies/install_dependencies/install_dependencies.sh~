# Need to download tensorflow for python to do calculations.
# To do this we need Python 3.5.x found at the below link:

# https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

# Once downloaded need to install tensorflow using

# pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow

# We also need to install the scipy library. To do this we need the miniconda library, available at:

# https://www.continuum.io/downloads

# Once downloaded create a Python 3.5 environment using the instructions here

# https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html

# Then install numpy and scipy using 

# conda install numpy
# conda install scipy
# conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow
# conda install
