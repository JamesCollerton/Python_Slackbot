# We need to install the scipy library. To do this we need the miniconda library, available at:

# https://www.continuum.io/downloads

# Once downloaded create a Python 3.5 environment using the instructions here

# https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html

# Then install other libraries using 

# conda install numpy
# conda install scipy
# conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow
# conda install pillow

# Also download the pre-trained VGG network using the link at the bottom
# of this page and put it in the top level directory of the python
# folder

# You will also need to install the twitter and slackbot libraries

# pip install tweepy
# pip install slackclient
